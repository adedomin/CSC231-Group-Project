Final, contribution By Anthony DeDominic

Being the Project Lead I generally had the roles of dictating the overall design and goals of the project.
Part of those responsibilities had me review code from my team members.

I also found myself offering advice to my team members on how to do things, such as letting Eclipse generate the getters and setters.

In terms of programming, I was generally responsible for all the Web (GUI) centric code, including the XHTML templates. I also wrote all the services which offered up persistently stored database objects such as national parks, visitors, etc.

I also made up the UML class diagram.
